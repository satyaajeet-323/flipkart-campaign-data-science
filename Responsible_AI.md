## Purpose & Scope

- **Goal:** Predict if a marketing campaign will be *High Performance* or *Low Performance*.
- **Use Case:** Internal analytics for marketing optimization and budget allocation.
- **Not for:** Employee performance evaluation, credit decisions, or automated campaign termination.

---

## Data Governance

- **No personal identifiers:** Customer names, phone numbers, addresses, or email addresses.
- **Columns limited to:** Campaign metrics and performance indicators (*Total_amt_of_sale*, *conversion_rate*, *click_through_rate*, *platform*, *campaign_budget*, etc.).
- **Dataset source:** Flipkart internal marketing campaigns data.
- **Artifacts tracked:** Model pipeline, expected columns, and reference data stored in `/artifacts/`.
- **Version control:** Data and models tracked with DVC for reproducibility.

## Model Fairness & Bias Mitigation

### ✅ Pre-processing Checks
- **Sensitive attributes identified:** Platform, campaign type, regional factors
- **Bias detection:** Group-wise performance analysis across different platforms
- **Fairness metrics:** Equalized odds, demographic parity monitoring

### ✅ In-processing Measures
- **Algorithm selection:** Random Forest with fairness constraints
- **Regularization:** Applied to prevent overfitting to specific campaign types
- **Cross-validation:** Stratified to maintain class balance across groups

### ✅ Post-processing Audits
- **Performance disparity monitoring:** Across different platform types
- **Threshold tuning:** Adjustable prediction thresholds for different segments
- **Regular fairness reports:** Generated through dashboard monitoring
